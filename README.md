# Super tic-tac-toe Game (Work in Progress)

This is a markdown file for the Super Tic Tac Toe game project that is currently under development.

## Description

Super tic-tac-toe is an advanced version of the classic tic-tac-toe game, played on a 3x3 grid of smaller tic-tac-toe boards. Each move determines the position on the smaller board, influencing the larger game. Beat your opponent by winning three smaller boards in a row, adding depth and strategy to the familiar game of tic-tac-toe.

## Features (Planned)

- Interactive gameplay on a visually appealing game board.
- Multiplayer mode: Play against a friend on the same device.
- Single-player mode: Challenge the computer AI with adjustable difficulty levels.
- Game statistics: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- Undo moves: Allow players to undo their previous moves.
- Sound effects: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects.

## Current Status

Completed features:

- Check win for each small Tic Tac Toe board.
- Gameplay for two players on the same device.

In progress:

- Checking the remaining unmarked large Tic Tac Toe boards to determine the win condition for the big board.

## Technologies Used

- Programming language: C#
- Framework: .NET WinForms
